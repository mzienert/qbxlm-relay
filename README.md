# QBXML Relay Service

A QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise to ZOHO CRM integration service built with AWS CDK, Node.js, and TypeScript.

## Overview

This project creates a relay service that connects QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise (via QuickBooks Web Connector) to ZOHO CRM. The service acts as a bridge, receiving QBXML data from QuickBooks and transforming it for synchronization with ZOHO CRM.

## Architecture
