need to sync invoice date
what are we going to need to pull from qb?
    duplicate checks - eg acc added to qb that is in zohocrm
    need to figure out how platforms talk to each other
    Last Invoice date
        doesnt exist in qb
        produce report that says give me active invoice for every customer for last 12 months
        zach would delete all rows except for the last invoice
        sean would import that spread sheet into chatgpt to clean up sheet
        then imported sheet matching fields and bulk imported into zoho 
        create an automation that says if an account has ordered in 2 months or greater then reach out
        account created in crm or qb needs to be checked and created in qb or zoho
        how to ask bi questions about sales data
        dont have weight in pos system
        if they had weight it would be easy to produce sales by weight volume, by total weight, by quantiy
        they are currently doing that by title, not necesarrily the best way to do it
        really need to figure out how to create a custom field in QB for last invoice date
        perhaps consider turning on invoicing module in qb, could be beneficial for the crm side, have workflow automation
        for things like who did we sell water filters to, when was the last time they purchased
        water filter are big, when they replace a filter they need to go in and manually update the date

        looking at at redshift or s3/glue/athena tables for data warehouse

        eventually begin to explore forecasting

        qb desktop enterprise deprecation

        coffee roaster is access program

        they have a db for green beans which is filemaker

        coffee loses 16.7% during roasting
        puts in how many batches per week, it adds it all up to calculate inventory and give insight
        into time to OOS.  being used to anticipate capaicty to ensure no OOS until next shipment arrival
        report tells him average over last 5 weeks.  brian goes in an enters into another sheet
        then enters into another sheet heres how much coffee, prices, batches per week, then gets average
        green cost and weighted average

        would be incredible to just by putting in by inventory, if it could do pricing, amount that is being used
        and then that information is just entered once, rather than in multiple places to get bi

        not quite as streamlined as could be currently multiple sheets being joined

        look at odoo crm - erp, crm, module based

        get 38000 lbs at a time, would like to know whats available, what are the prices, what do we have
        opportunity to anticipate green commitments

        handful of big suppliers and then some smaller suppliers

        eg 2027 already commited to 50% to provide reliability to farmers/suppliers

        sometimes will push off more expensive blend and bring in cheaper. a lot of variability in green buying
        looking for potential predicition

        having chatgpt sort by lot codes code eg etu2404 lot number is on end etu is ethiopia would like to know
        how many ethiopia baught in a given months

        elements to map from zoho
             last invoice date - to trigger
             annual revenue
             invoicing history - crm access outside of billing
             account object isn't built for invoicing but zoho has an 
                invoicing module for an additional cost..maybe additional cost
                look into how this will map

            account info from qb and zoho - has mapping process already because they don't quite align
            contacts object is its own module
            seems like module in zoho === objects
            contacts are leads or accounts
            qb isn't great for managing multiple contacts
            sop is to use contacts module and map them to account
            contacts will be more complex in crm than in qb
            more important to reference crm account 
            most important aspect from quick books to zoho is acc name
            double check whether it exists
            invoice history
