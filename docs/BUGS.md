## Resolved Issues

### ‚úÖ Fixed

#### [RESOLVED-001] DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery Overkill
- **Description**: DynamoDB tables were configured with Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) which was overkill for session management data
- **Resolution**: Disabled PITR for all environments in CDK configuration (`pointInTimeRecovery: false`)

#### [RESOLVED-003] DynamoDB Duplicate Property Error
- **Description**: Duplicate `ExpressionAttributeValues` properties in session manager
- **Resolution**: Merged duplicate properties in `lambda/qbwc-handler/session-manager.ts`
- **Resolved**: 2025-08-20

#### [RESOLVED-004] CDK Version Incompatibility
